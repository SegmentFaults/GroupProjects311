So these keys are already operable on the OpenStack server. The private key has no extension. This should already be syncronized to the OpenStack server. The pub and the ppk are used to authenticate. Use the ppk under the "Auth" section of puTTY. You can log into the cloud systems with the username "kiper-lab" and use the password "m1am1". The domain should be set to "default". Use the floating point IPs to authenticate to the system. ubuntu@"ipaddress" is the format. Have fun.
IPS are as followed:
1: 172.17.31.206
2: 172.17.31.234
3: 172.17.31.141
4: 172.17.31.162
5: 172.17.31.152
